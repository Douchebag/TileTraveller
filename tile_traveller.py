#  The program allows the user to input one of four directions, the user then travels to that direction
#  depending on wether the direction is valid. Once the user has reached the end tile a message is displayed.
#  The user starts on a tile [1, 1] and the victory tile is [3, 1]. 
#  This should be able to be accomplished with ifelse loops inside a function and a while loop running in the main program.
